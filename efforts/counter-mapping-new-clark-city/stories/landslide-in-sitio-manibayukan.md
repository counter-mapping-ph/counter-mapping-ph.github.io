# Landslide in Sitio Manibayukan

Sitio Manibayukan is one of the ten sitios comprising what is collectively known as Sitio Kalangitan. On August 2018, a landslide originating from the site of an ongoing upland road construction for the New Clark City occurred in Sitio Manibayukan. The landslide, which occurred after torrential rains in the area resulting to a mass wasting event consisting of boulders and loose soil, caused the demise of a young girl in Sitio Manibayukan. The landslide was reported to bore a hole in an unused septic tank. The continuous rain during this period filled up said tank and the child who was left playing unsupervised fell into the tank and drowned.  The locals have reported the incident to the authorities in hopes that they could do something regarding this risk but no action was done until the time of writing.

Aside from the death it caused, the landslide last August 2018 also affected livelihood in Sitio Manibayukan. Upon the team's visit, a resident also gave details on how a nearby animal farm had to move most of their livestock and poultry to another area after majority of their coops was found to be on the direct path of oncoming landslides.
At the time of writing, the upland road construction is still in full swing  and another landslide on the area was reported after another bout of torrential rains last March 2019.
