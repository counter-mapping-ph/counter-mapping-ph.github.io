<h1 class='my-4'>Mental Maps</h1>
<p>
Mental mapping was conducted to create mental maps. These maps, also called cognitive maps, pertain to images that reflect an individualâ€™s perception, knowledge and impression of how a particular space is configured.
<br><br>
The mental mapping activity was conducted separately for children, women, and farmers. Participants developed their own mental maps of their community by identifying sites of everyday importance, their everyday mobilities, and places of dispossession and resistance. Mental maps were processed during focus group discussions and informed the community maps generated.
